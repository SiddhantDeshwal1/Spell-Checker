Efficient Trie-Based Dictionary with Suggestions and Error Tolerance
An advanced C++ project demonstrating the power of Trie data structures combined with the Levenshtein Distance algorithm for an intelligent dictionary. This application excels in high-speed exact search, prefix-based suggestions, and error-tolerant matching for misspelled queries.

üìú Purpose of the Project
The goal of this project is to create a fast, reliable, and user-friendly dictionary capable of:

Exact word matches for precise lookups.
Auto-suggestions to assist with incomplete queries.
Error correction using Levenshtein Distance, offering close matches for misspelled words.
This project is particularly beneficial for applications like:

Search Engines: Enhanced user experience by tolerating minor typos.
Educational Tools: Helping users learn correct spellings.
Assistive Technology: Supporting individuals with typing or language difficulties.
üöÄ Features
Trie Implementation: Efficient prefix-based operations for high-speed insert, search, and suggestions.
Levenshtein Distance Algorithm: Intelligent correction of misspelled queries by finding words with minimal edit distances.
Case-Insensitive Matching: Seamlessly handles uppercase and lowercase input.
Error Correction: Suggests the closest valid word(s) for user typos.
Optimized Memory Usage: Utilizes an array-based Trie (size 52) for better space and time efficiency.
‚öôÔ∏è Algorithms and Techniques
1. Trie Data Structure:
Nodes store children using a fixed-size array of 52 (for a-z and A-Z).
Provides constant-time access for each character.
Insert and search operations have a time complexity of O(L), where L is the length of the word.
2. Levenshtein Distance:
Calculates the edit distance between two strings.
Measures the number of operations (insertions, deletions, substitutions) required to transform one word into another.
Used to rank suggestions by proximity to the input.
Example:
Input: amzon

Suggestions (ranked by edit distance): amazon, amaze, amazing

Time Complexity: O(N √ó M), where N is the length of the input word and M is the average length of dictionary words.

3. Recursive Suggestion Algorithm:
Traverses all possible completions of a given prefix using depth-first traversal.
Returns valid words in lexicographical order.
üìú How It Works
Input
A dictionary file (e.g., dictionary.txt) to populate the Trie.
User queries (exact matches, prefixes, or potentially misspelled words).
Output
Exact Match: Confirms if the word exists in the dictionary.
Suggestions:
Prefix Suggestions: Returns possible completions for incomplete inputs.
Error-Tolerant Suggestions: Provides words closest to the input, ranked by Levenshtein Distance.
üìñ Example
Input:
text
Copy code
Word List: amaz, amazon, amaze, amazing, amazingly
Query: amaz
Output:
text
Copy code
Exact Match: Word found.
Suggestions: amazon, amaze, amazing, amazingly
‚ú® How It Helped
Real-Time Feedback: Enables users to find the correct word or suggestions instantly.
Error Correction: Helps users identify and fix typos in queries.
Performance: Built on C++ for unmatched speed, ensuring real-time operation even for large dictionaries.
Scalability: The efficient use of Tries and arrays allows handling millions of words with low memory overhead.
üìÇ File Structure
Trie.h: Header file for TrieNode and Trie class definitions.
Trie.cpp: Implementation file for Trie operations, including insertion, search, and suggestions.
main.cpp: Demonstrates the usage of the Trie with dictionary data and queries.
dictionary.txt: Sample word list.
